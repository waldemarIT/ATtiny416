# ATtiny416
This embedded project demonstrates a low-power system implemented on the ATtiny416 microcontroller using C. The device cycles through three operational states (Sleep, Active, Monitoring) depending on button input and sensor readings, optimizing energy consumption while maintaining responsive behavior.
